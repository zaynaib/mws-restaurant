## How to Use

Step 1: Download Repo

`clone https://github.com/zaynaib/mws-restaurant-stage-1.git`

Or click on the green download button on the upper right corner of this github page.

Step 2: Go to the location where all the files are stored on your local machine.

Step 3: Open up a terminal and run your localhost server.

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
